# IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

## Rules

- One plan item per loop iteration.
- Every plan item has a stable ID: `PI-0001`, `PI-0002`, ...
- Status is one of: `TODO`, `DOING`, `DONE`, `BLOCKED`.
- Each plan item must include:
  - Scope
  - Done when (explicit verification)
  - Notes/risks
  - Evidence (where to find logs/output)
- If AUTO_COMMIT=1, commit messages must start with the plan item ID, e.g. `PI-0007: ...`.
